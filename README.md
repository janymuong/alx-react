# REACT

> ## About
> JavaScript;  
> [`React`](https://react.dev/) is a `JavaScript library` for building user `interfaces`. It is widely used for creating interactive and dynamic web applications. React allows developers to build reusable UI *components* and manage *the state* of an application efficiently.


## Features

- **Component-Based Architecture:** React follows a component-based architecture, allowing developers to create encapsulated and reusable UI components. This makes it easier to manage and maintain complex user interfaces.

- **Virtual DOM:** React uses a virtual DOM to optimize the rendering process. Instead of updating the entire DOM when changes occur, React updates only the parts that have changed in the virtual DOM and then efficiently updates the real DOM.

- **Declarative Syntax:** React uses a declarative syntax, making it easier to understand and predict how the UI will behave. Developers describe the desired state of the UI, and React takes care of updating the DOM to match that state.

- **Unidirectional Data Flow:** React follows a unidirectional data flow, which means that data in an application flows in a single direction. This makes it easier to understand how data changes over time and helps prevent bugs.


## Create REACT app;
```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
npx create-react-app my-react-app
cd my-react-app && npm start
```
